What it does?

The Platformer Challenge Chunk Generator creates small, reusable platforming challenge segments
with mechanics like wall-jumping, momentum gaps, and vertical climbing. It uses adjustable parameters
(Difficulty, Verticality, Density, Spacing) with built-in randomness to produce varied outputs. The tool exports chunks as PNG images for reference
and JSON files that game developers can import directly into Unity, Godot, or Tiled Map Editor

What to use the tool for?

Use this tool to quickly generate platforming challenges for 2D games without hand-placing every tile.It's perfect for rapid level prototyping,building a
reusable challenge library, or getting design inspiration during game jams. Game designers can export chunks and assemble them into complete levels in their 
game engine of choice

How to use it? 

Select a Challenge Type and adjust the parameter sliders (Difficulty, Verticality, Density), then click "Generate Single Chunk" or "Batch Generate" to create challenges.
Review the visual preview and generate multiple times to see variation from the built-in randomness. Export chunks as PNG for reference or JSON/Tiled
format for direct import into your game engine - the JSON includes a 2D tile array with IDs (0-10) mapped to tile types like floor, platform, ladder, spike, etc

Parameters: 

- Difficulty
- Verticality
- Density
- Spaces
